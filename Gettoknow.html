        <p>
        Hey guys! welcome to my portfolio page, thank you for taking time to look around. What you see in front of you its a leap of faih that I took in my life. I used to work in the biomedical and nutraceutical industry working in the quality department doing all sorts of jobs and was successful while doing it. <br>
        As time passed on I wanted to try something new and follow a different career that combine my passions and open doors that I wanted to pursue. 
        
        I joined Wyncode Acamedy to pursue front end web development, I was always interested in coding but also the different path that exist in development from the creative aspects to the technical ones.

        </li>
        <li>
            Keep learning all that i can from design (UI/UX) to back-end and security with compTIA certificates.
        </li>
        <li>
            Move to Charlotte , North Carolina or Orlando, Florida.
